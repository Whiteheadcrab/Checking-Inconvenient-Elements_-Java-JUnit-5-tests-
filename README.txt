During this project I tried to test simple class ( checkingVariables ) which main goal is to check string variables for containing inconvenient elements , this time these inconvenient elements are "?" and "$" , and changing them .

For testing this java project I used tested which has been created by using JUnit 5 , as the newest version of JUnit technology . And this project has been created by using Java and Eclipse Oxygen IDE.

I divided all tests into several test cases:
- checkingEmptyVariablesTest . This test case will check could all our methods work without interruption if we will send to them empty variables .
- checkingLettersTest . This test case will check the method checkingLetters and it's work with element "$" .
- checkingNumbersTest . This test case will check the method checkingNumbers and it's work with element "?" .
- checkingBothTypesdTest . This test case will check the work of all three methods (checkingLetters , checkingNumbers and checkingBothTypes ) with string variable where we elements "$" and "?".
- checkingWithoutChangingTest. This test case will check the work of all three methods with string variable where we are no elements which we chose as inconvenient and which need to find and change.

In case of finding any problems or question please contact with me.
